## major hurdles

(defer) "sign" in browser / mobile

## reasonable wins

(bug) make sure not logged in can submit form
(bug) double replace tags in html
make sure the bucket has sane RLS
(defer) unifty types-> assigned form and form
(defer) make sure that anyone at the user level can see things in their daycare
(defer) reject non-pdf
(in progress) move types to one folder (can we not just autogenerate these?)
(defer) unified table component with filtering etc

## fixes

(defer, can use resend dashboard)not sure why status doesnt get updated in edge function (maybe rls?)
