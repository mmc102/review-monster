## major hurdles

(defer) "sign" in browser / mobile

## reasonable wins

(bug) view signed for is not working
(bug) 404 on dashboard

make sure the bucket has sane RLS
(defer) make sure that anyone at the user level can see things in their daycare
(defer) reject non-pdf
(in progress) move types to one folder (can we not just autogenerate these?)
(defer) unified table component with filtering etc

## fixes

(defer, can use resend dashboard)not sure why status doesnt get updated in edge function (maybe rls?)
