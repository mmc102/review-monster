major hurdles:

"sign" in browser / mobile

reasonable wins:
make sure that anyone at the user level can see things in their daycare
make sure a non-signed in user can upload the form
make sure the bucket has sane RLS
reject non-pdf


move types to one folder (can we not just autogenerate these?)


fixes:
not sure why status doesnt get updated in edge function (maybe rls?)
download signed form isnt working
when assinging forms change the state on the page
